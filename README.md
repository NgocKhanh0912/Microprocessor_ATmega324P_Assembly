This repository will consist of 3 sections: 
- Section 1 provides a theoretical overview of the Assembly language (registers, flags, memory...) of ATmega324P as well as Input/Output Ports and the Experiment Kit.
- Section 2: from Lab 1 to Lab 5 covers experiments in the classroom on UART, SPI, I2C, ADC, Timers, Interrupts. These experiments involve tasks such as Pulse Width Modulation, LED scanning, LCD display, DC motor control, working with a matrix keyboard and so on.
- Section 3: Lab for Honors Program includes extended assignments assigned during the Honors Program, with the topic being: "Design a system for weighing goods and calculating payments".
